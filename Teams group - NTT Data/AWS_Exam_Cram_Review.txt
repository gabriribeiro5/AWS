***IAM - Instance Access Management***
USER: person or service

    Programmatic access: access key ID + secret access key
    Management Console access: password (define polices for length, complexity, etc)
  Default: no access for new IAM users
  ROOT Account:
    Enable Multi-factor Authentication
    Create IAM user and assign admin permissions as required
    ARN - Amazon Resource Name: unique user id on AWS
GROUP: user groups
  Have polices attached and applied to common users
  Can not have nested groups (groups within groups)
ROLES:
  Exemple: S3 Full Access, DynamoDB Read-Only, Lambda Basic Execution
  Users can assume roles for temp access
POLICIES:
  All permissions are denied by Default
  The most restrictive police is applied over less restrictive ones
  POLICY SIMULATOR:
    Helps understand, test and validate policy effects
  CONDITION ELEMENT: apply further conditional logic

**GLOBAL INFRASTRUCTURE**
  Region: Geographical, 2 or more AZÂ´s, isolated from other regions;
  Availability Zone: Data Centers physically isolated from others AZs;
  Edge Location: low latency delivery of cached content (used by CloudFront);
  Regional Edge Location: Large caches that sitsa between AWS Services and Edge Locations (used by CloudFront);
  Global Network: Connects DCenters, AZs and AWS regions. It's a highly available, low-latency, private Network.
